/**
 * A flat immutable union of {@code Type}s. Here "flat" means a union type never contains another
 * union type.

// Other operations we may want:
//
// - lub: fold lub over the elements of the union. This will be less useful with
//   the spec-defined lub, but more useful with a custom lub that e.g. defines
//   [lub(List<int>, List<double>) = List<dynamic>].

// Discussion
//
// The union type is not really like other types in the implementation:
//
// - union types are never associated with [Element]s.
// - no user program ever declares one.
// - no value ever has union type.
// - they are never components of other types (e.g., never have [G<X|Y>]).
//
// With this in mind, I was initially inclined to not make [UnionType] a subtype of [Type].
// However, that causes problems if we want to make the propagated type a union type, since
// much existing code depends on the propagated type being a [Type].
// Moreover, by making [UnionType] a [Type], we can more easily do
// other type-related things with it in the future.  For example, if we were doing type
// inference for functions, then we might infer that a function returned a union type.  So,
// [UnionType extends Type].
